Today, I worked on a project where I deployed the 2048 game using **AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**. I learned how to set up a Kubernetes cluster on AWS, deploy the game in pods, and make it accessible online through a web link using an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**.

## üìö Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a simple web game (2048) on an **AWS-managed Kubernetes cluster (EKS)**. I used **Fargate** for serverless compute, configured networking with **Ingress and ALB**, and exposed the game to the internet for anyone to play.

## üåü What I Learned

### 1. What is AWS EKS?

* **EKS** is a fully managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS.
* It separates responsibilities:

  * **Control Plane**: Managed by AWS (API server, scheduler, etc.)
  * **Worker Nodes**: Run your applications ‚Äî I used **Fargate** to avoid managing servers.
* **Why EKS?**
  Saves time by handling server maintenance, scaling, and updates automatically.

---

### 2. Kubernetes Basics

* **Pods**: The smallest deployable units ‚Äî where the 2048 game runs.
* **Services**: Expose pods to each other or the outside world.
* **Ingress**: Routes external traffic to the appropriate service.
* **Load Balancer (ALB)**: Makes the game accessible via a public URL.

---

### 3. Setting Up the EKS Cluster

Installed the following tools:

* `kubectl`: To interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
* `eksctl`: To create and configure the EKS cluster.
* `AWS CLI`: To authenticate and manage AWS resources.

**Cluster Creation Command:**

```bash
eksctl create cluster --name my-cool-cluster --region us-east-1 --fargate
```

---

### 4. Deploying the 2048 Game

* Created a **namespace** `game2048`
* Deployed the game using a **Deployment** with 5 replicas
* Exposed it using a **Service**
* Used **Ingress** to route external traffic
* Set up a **Fargate Profile** to run pods in the `game2048` namespace

---

### 5. Making the Game Public

* Set up **IAM permissions** to allow EKS to manage ALB
* Installed the **AWS Load Balancer Controller** via Helm

**Key Commands:**

```bash
# Set up IAM OIDC provider
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster my-cool-cluster --approve

# Install ALB Controller with Helm
helm install aws-load-balancer-controller eks/aws-load-balancer-controller \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set clusterName=my-cool-cluster \
  --set region=us-east-1 \
  --set vpcId=<your-vpc-id>
```

---

### 6. Accessing the Game Online

* After deployment, the **ALB Controller** generated a public URL (e.g., `abc123.aws.com`)
* Opened the URL in a browser and played 2048 online! üéâ

---

### 7. Troubleshooting Tips

* If the game wasn‚Äôt accessible:

  * Verified Fargate Profile settings
  * Checked pod status with:

    ```bash
    kubectl get pods -n game2048
    ```
  * Used `kubectl describe` and `kubectl logs` to debug
