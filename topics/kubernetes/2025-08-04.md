Today, I worked on a project about AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). I learned how to set up a Kubernetes cluster on AWS, put the 2048 game 🎮 on it, and make it playable online with a web link.

📚 What’s This Project About?
This project is about using AWS EKS, a tool that makes running Kubernetes (a way to manage apps) super easy. I set up a cluster, added the 2048 game, and made it available online using something called an Application Load Balancer (ALB). It’s like putting a game on the internet for anyone to play! 😊

🌟 What I Learned
1. What’s AWS EKS? 🤗

EKS is an AWS tool that runs Kubernetes without you having to manage everything.
It has two parts:
Control Plane: The brain of the cluster, handled by AWS (includes stuff like API Server and Scheduler). They fix crashes or updates for you! ✅
Worker Nodes: Where your apps run. I used Fargate, a no-hassle option, so I didn’t have to manage servers.


Why EKS? It saves time by handling the hard stuff, like fixing broken servers or updating certificates.

2. Kubernetes Basics 🧩

Pods: Tiny containers where apps like the 2048 game live.
Services: Help apps talk to each other or the outside world.
Ingress: Sends internet traffic to your app.
Load Balancer: A web address that lets people access your app online.

3. Setting Up the EKS Cluster 🌈

I installed three tools on my computer:
kubectl: To talk to the Kubernetes cluster.
eksctl: To create the EKS cluster.
AWS CLI: To log into my AWS account.


I ran a command to create a cluster with Fargate, so I didn’t need to manage servers.

Command Example:
eksctl create cluster --name my-cool-cluster --region us-east-1 --fargate

4. Adding the 2048 Game 🎲

Created a namespace called game2048 (like a folder for the game).
Used a Deployment to run the 2048 game in pods (set it to run 5 copies for lots of players).
Added a Service to connect to the game pods.
Used Ingress to let people play the game online.
Set up a Fargate Profile so the game could run in the game2048 folder.


5. Making the Game Public 🌐

Ingress: Tells the system how to send web traffic to the 2048 game.
ALB Controller: A helper that creates a web address (called an Application Load Balancer) so people can play the game.
Set up IAM permissions (like a key) so the ALB Controller could work with AWS.

Commands Used:
# Set up IAM permissions
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster my-cool-cluster --approve

# Install ALB Controller
helm install aws-load-balancer-controller eks/aws-load-balancer-controller \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set clusterName=my-cool-cluster \
  --set region=us-east-1 \
  --set vpcId=<your-vpc-id>

6. Playing the Game Online 🎉

The ALB Controller gave me a web address (like abc123.aws.com).
I opened it in my browser and played the 2048 game! 😄

7. Fixing Problems 🔧

If the game didn’t work, I checked the Fargate Profile or IAM permissions.
Used commands like kubectl get pods -n game2048 to see if the game was running.
Looked for errors with kubectl describe or kubectl logs.


🛠️ Tools I Used

kubectl: To control the Kubernetes cluster.
eksctl: To set up the EKS cluster.
AWS CLI: To log into AWS.
Helm: To add the ALB Controller.
GitHub: Saved all my commands and files.
