Today, I worked on a project about AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). It’s all about setting up a Kubernetes cluster on AWS, putting a fun game (2048 🎮) on it, and making it available for anyone to play using a web address. I’m breaking it down in simple words with some neat diagrams to make it easy to follow! 🚀

📚 What’s This Project About?
This project is about how to use AWS EKS (a tool to run Kubernetes easily) to launch the 2048 game. The game ends up online, so anyone can play it using a web link. I learned how to create the cluster, add the game, and connect it to the internet with something called an Application Load Balancer (ALB). Let’s dive in! 😊

🌟 What I Learned
1. What’s AWS EKS? 🤗

EKS is like a helper from AWS that makes running Kubernetes (a tool to manage apps in containers) super easy.
It has two parts:
Control Plane (Master Nodes): AWS handles this part, like the brain of the cluster (API Server, etcd, Scheduler). No stress about crashes or updates! ✅
Worker Nodes: These run your apps. You can use EC2 instances (like virtual computers) or Fargate (a no-hassle serverless option).


Why EKS? It saves time by managing the hard stuff, so you don’t have to fix things like broken servers or expired certificates.

    style C fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px


2. Kubernetes Basics 🧩

Control Plane: The brain that controls everything.
Worker Nodes: Where your apps live in pods (like little app containers).
Services: Help apps talk to each other or the outside world.
Ingress: Guides internet traffic to your app.

3. Setting Up the EKS Cluster 🌈

I installed three tools on my computer:
kubectl: To talk to the Kubernetes cluster.
eksctl: To create and manage the EKS cluster.
AWS CLI: To connect to my AWS account.


Used a command to create the cluster with Fargate (so I don’t need to manage servers).

Command Example:
eksctl create cluster --name my-cool-cluster --region us-east-1 --fargate

4. Adding the 2048 Game 🎲

Made a namespace called game2048 (like a folder for the app).
Created a Deployment to run the 2048 game in pods.
Added a Service to connect to the pods.
Used Ingress to let people access the game from the internet.
Set up a Fargate Profile so the game can run in the game2048 namespace.

YAML File (Simplified):
# Namespace
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  name: game2048

# Deployment (Runs the 2048 Game)
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: game2048
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: game2048
  template:
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: game2048
        image: 2048-game-image
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80

# Service (Connects to Pods)
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: service2048
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: game2048
  ports:
  - port: 80
    targetPort: 80

# Ingress (Routes Internet Traffic)
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: ingress2048
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: alb
spec:
  rules:
  - http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        backend:
          service:
            name: service2048
            port:
              number: 80

    style E fill:#fbf,stroke:#333

    A[User Browser] --> B[ALB(Public URL)]
    B --> C[Ingress(game2048)]
    C --> D[Service(NodePort)]
    D --> E[Pod(2048 Game)]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333

    style C fill:#bfb,stroke:#333
    style D fill:#ffb,stroke:#333
    style E fill:#fbf,stroke:#333


5. Making the Game Public with Ingress & ALB 🚀

Ingress: Tells the system how to route traffic (e.g., if someone visits a web address, send them to the 2048 game).
ALB Controller: A helper pod that creates an Application Load Balancer (ALB) to handle internet traffic.
Set up IAM OIDC Provider and IAM Role so the ALB Controller can talk to AWS.

Command for IAM OIDC:
eksctl utils associate-iam-oidc-provider --cluster my-cool-cluster --approve

Command for ALB Controller:
helm install aws-load-balancer-controller eks/aws-load-balancer-controller \
  --namespace kube-system \
  --set clusterName=my-cool-cluster \
  --set region=us-east-1 \
  --set vpcId=<your-vpc-id>

6. Playing the Game Online 🌐

The ALB Controller created a web address (DNS) for the game.
I opened the address in my browser and played the 2048 game! 🎉

Diagram:
graph TD
    A[Your Browser] --> B[ALB DNS<br>(e.g., abc123.aws.com)]
    B --> C[Ingress]
    C --> D[Service]
    D --> E[2048 Game Pod]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style C fill:#bfb,stroke:#333
    style D fill:#ffb,stroke:#333
    style E fill:#fbf,stroke:#333


graph TD
    A[Your Browser] --> B[ALB DNS(e.g., abc123.aws.com)]
    B --> C[Ingress]
    C --> D[Service]
    D --> E[2048 Game Pod]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333
    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333
    style C fill:#bfb,stroke:#333
    style D fill:#ffb,stroke:#333
    style E fill:#fbf,stroke:#333


7. Fixing Problems 🔧

If pods aren’t working, check the Fargate Profile or Service Account.
If the ALB doesn’t show up, make sure the IAM Role and OIDC Provider are set correctly.
Use commands like kubectl get pods -n game2048 to see what’s going on.
Check errors with kubectl describe or kubectl logs.


🛠️ Tools I Used
